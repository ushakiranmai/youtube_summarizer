# youtube_summarizer
 This project summarizes YouTube video transcripts by extracting them using the YouTube Transcript API and summarizing with the Hugging Face transformers model (distilbart-cnn-12-6). It splits the transcript into chunks, summarizes each, and combines them into a final summary. A Gradio interface is used for user interaction.
