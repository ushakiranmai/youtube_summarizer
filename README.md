# 🎬 YouTube Script Summarizer 📜
Transform your YouTube videos into summarized content in seconds!

The YouTube Script Summarizer is an innovative tool that allows you to quickly summarize YouTube video transcripts. It fetches the transcript of a video, breaks it down into digestible chunks, and uses powerful AI models to generate a concise, readable summary. All of this is done effortlessly through a user-friendly web interface.

# 🚀 Features
Automatic Transcript Extraction: Effortlessly fetch YouTube video transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API.
Smart Text Summarization: Summarizes lengthy video scripts into easy-to-understand summaries using the Hugging Face Transformer model (distilbart-cnn-12-6).
Chunked Summarization: Transcripts are chunked to fit model input requirements and ensure better summary quality.
Interactive Gradio Interface: Enter any YouTube URL, and instantly receive a concise video summary.

# 📦 Requirements
- Before running the tool, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **transformers: For powerful text summarization models.**
- **youtube-transcript-api: To extract transcripts from YouTube videos.**
- **gradio: For an interactive web interface.**
- **torch: Essential for model operations using PyTorch.**
- You can install these dependencies by running:
- **pip install transformers**
- **youtube-transcript-api**
- **gradio**
- **torch**
  
# 🚀 Quick Start
Ready to get started? Follow these simple steps:
- Clone the Repository:
- **git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-script-summarizer.git**
-Navigate to the Project Folder:
- **cd youtube-script-summarizer**
- Run the App:
- **python app.py**
- Open the Web Interface: Once the app is running, open your browser and go to the Gradio interface to enter a YouTube video URL.

Get Your Summary: Paste your YouTube URL, and instantly get a concise, summarized version of the video script.

# ✨ How it Works
- **Input: Paste any YouTube video URL into the Gradio interface.**
- **Transcript Extraction: The script automatically fetches the video's transcript using the YouTube Transcript API.**
- **Text Chunking: The transcript is divided into smaller chunks to ensure that it fits within the AI model's input constraints.**
- **Summarization: Each chunk is summarized using the distilbart-cnn-12-6 model.**
- **Final Output: The individual chunk summaries are combined into a comprehensive, concise video summary.**

# 🎯 Example Use Case
- Input: You provide the URL of any YouTube video, like this:
- **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id**
- Output: The app returns a readable summary of the video’s transcript. For example:
- **In this video, we will discuss the fundamentals of machine learning. The focus will be on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We will explain the key concepts and explore the real-world applications of these techniques to provide a solid foundation for beginners.**
